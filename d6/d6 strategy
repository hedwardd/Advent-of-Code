Input: Coordinates
Output: Area of largest finite area of locations closest (manhattan) to a single coordinate

Strategy 1:
Map all coordinates in finite area, count numbers that don't appear infinite?

Strategy 2:
Sort coordinates, then iterate over area

Strategy 3:
Eliminate all coordinates along the outside (unbounded)

Infinites:
Strategy 1 for sorting out infinite:
If they touch the edge, they're infinite
